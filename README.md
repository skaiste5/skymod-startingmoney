Gives you $500,000 instead of $70,000 at the start of a city to move quicker and shorten the beginning phase of building the city.

## How to Build

1. Clone the source.
2. Open in Visual Studio (tested on 2013).
3. Add the game assembly path to the [project reference paths](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/6taasyc6(v=vs.100).aspx).
  1. The path is `[SteamLibrary]\steamapps\common\Cities_Skylines\Cities_Data\Managed`, where `[SteamLibrary]` is your Steam library folder.
4. Build.
